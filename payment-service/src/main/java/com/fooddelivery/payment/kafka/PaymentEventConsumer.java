/**
 * KAFKA CONSUMER - Payment Service
 *
 * This class LISTENS to Kafka topics and consumes order events.
 * When a new order is placed, this service processes the payment.
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. Order Service publishes "ORDER_CREATED" event to Kafka
 * 2. This consumer receives the event automatically
 * 3. Payment is processed
 * 4. Payment status is updated
 *
 * Benefits of Kafka Consumer:
 * - Asynchronous processing (doesn't block Order Service)
 * - Automatic retry on failure
 * - Can process events at its own pace
 * - Scalable (multiple consumers can process in parallel)
